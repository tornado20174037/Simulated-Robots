# Simulated-Robots
The objective of this project is to move three simulated robots using ROS 1 and Gazebo from a starting position to the adequate flag (e.g. robot1 going to flag1, robot2 going to flag2 and robot3 going to flag3) while avoiding any collision with another robot. The main goal is to reach the adequate flag as fast as possible.
